**Unblocked: A Definition**

Unblocked games are essentially online games that bypass restrictions imposed by networks or institutions. This means they can be played directly from a web browser without needing any special software or permissions. Think of them as a digital playground, accessible whenever you need a break or a quick burst of entertainment.

* **Variety:** From classic arcade games like Pac-Man and Tetris to modern puzzle games and even online multiplayers, there's something for everyone.  The vast library of unblocked games caters to diverse tastes and preferences.
* **Free to Play:**  The majority of unblocked games are free to play, making them a budget-friendly option for casual gamers and those looking for a quick escape without spending a dime.
